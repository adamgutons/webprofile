This is free to whoever can use it.  I wrote this with help from Jon Duckett, w3schools, 
mozilla webdev docs, CCAC, and others.  As of today, October 3 2018 I am fraggin'
proud of the @keyframes that I wrote to move icons around.  holler for a doller because
javascript can suck it...just kidding it's neat but I can not find any time to learn it.
Please send any suggestions to adamgutonski@protonmail.com
