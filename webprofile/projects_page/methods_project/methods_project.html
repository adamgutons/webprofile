     <h1>Description of Frequency Calculator Mini-project</h1>
     <p>----------------------------------</p>      
    <p>
    For my mini-project I coded a program that will calculate sound frequency based on the traditional
    formula, frequency = velocity/wavelength.   The program contains two methods besides the main method.  They are 
    convertWavelengthToNanoMeters(); and calcFrequency();.  The first method to execute is convertWavelengthToNanoMeters();
    and it acts on the variable double wavelengthNm.
    </p>  
    <p>
    I decided that any wavelength value entered by the user will be in nanometers (this allows for more 
    conversion/method creation practice).  First the user is prompted via System.out.println to enter a wavelength value.  A scanner 
    object stores the user input in the double wavelengthNm variable.  Next, the variable double wavelength is defined as the result of 
    the convertWavelengthToNanoMeters(); method when the double wavelengthNm argument is passed through.
    </p>   
    <p>
    The convertWavelengthToNanoMeters(); method first defines the double conversionVal = (1/10^9) allowing
    conversion from nanometers to meters.  The next variable, double wavelength, stores the reference from multiplying double wavelengthNm
    by double conversionVal.  The return variable holds the resulting value for the convertWavelengthToNanoMeters(); method.
    </p>
    <p>
    Another System.out.println will prompt the user to enter a value for velocity.  The scanner object stores
    the data reference in the double velocityNm variable.  Next, the variable double frequency is defined as the result of the calcFrequency();
    method when the double velocityNm and double wavelength arguments are passed through. The calcFrequency(); method defines double frequency =
    (velictyNm/wavelength).  The return frequency references the result of the equation.  A culminating System.out.println method displays the
    frequency result to the user in Hz.
    </p>

    <h1>The Heart of the Matter</h1>
    <p>
    Contracts are a great metaphor for explaining methods because contracts are binding.  Contracts are bound
    to the written terms and signatures applied to it.  In this same fashion, methods and their variables are bound to their return types.  If a
    contract says that a person must work 40 hours per week to get paid, and that person signs the agreement, they MUST work 40 hours per week or risk
    termination.  Similarly, if a method is defined with a “double” return type, it must use “double” variables and return “double” data.  Otherwise,
    the method will not work, or in other words, terminate.
    </p>
    <p>
    The metaphor also helps to explain variable scope within methods.  For example, an employee may sign a contract
    with Company A that explicitly forbids the employee to work for Company B.  The employee will face termination should they try and call/contact Company
    B for employment.  Again a method and its variables work in a congruent manner.  If a variable is defined in method A, it cannot be called in method B
    (unless otherwise defined, or in other words, the contract is re-written).  When the variable from method A is called in method B, the program does not work!
    Terminated!
