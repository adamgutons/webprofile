            <h3>File-write practice with rock-paper-scissors</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>This was an attempt at using Java to recreate the rock-paper-scissors script that I worked out
                when first learning Python.  Since I have been ingrained in the Pythonic landscape, it
                was a fun challenge to dive back into a lower level language like Java, (even though
                some don't consider it low level enough).  It also gave me opportunity to use NetBeans more.
                I do use it now to edit HTML and CSS documents, it was my first love as an IDE.
                The program consists of two classes, <i>gamePlay</i> which contains the game logic, and <i>practicingAgain</i>
                which runs the main method.  The <i>gamePlay</i> class contains generator methods for the final private
                string variables for "rock, paper, scissor".  We instatiate a <i>gamePlay</i> object in the <i>practicingAgain</i>
                class, as well as a boolean variable, a "quit" string variable, and Scanner object.</p>

            <p>
                The program enters a while loop, controlled via the <i>startGame</i> boolean.  In the loop a counter variable adds 1
                to keep track of gameplay count.  The <i>gamePlay</i> object newGame calls on the getRandomChoice() method to generate
                the computer choice of "rock, paper, scissors".  The if blocks in the while loop then compare the user input form the scanner
                to the pseudo-random selection generated by this method (returns a string of "rock, paper, scissors", string comparisons
                like in the Python script.)  Here is the opening of the <i>gamePlay</i> class that shows the class variables and getRandomChoice()
                method.
            </p>
            <img src="../../image/java_rps_code2.jpg">
            <p>
                You can see that the class variables are private final so that they can not be altered after instatiating a <i>gamePlay</i>
                object.   The class also imports the java.util package in order to generate a Random object in the getRandomChoice() method. The random
                object allows for a pseudorandom selection from the String[] array variable.  This method is called on in main, and the random selection of 
                "rock, paper, scissors" is stored in the computerChoice variable.

            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>I must submit to the will of the programming gods.  It is a life long learning journey, especially for someone
                who has only picked up their technical studies within the last year.  What I mean is that I am constantly learning.
                The process of making this game over a few nights last summer (yes a few nights...) was envigorating.  First, I am proud
                because I accomplished this script without consulting google.  Second, I am proud because I was able to make this script
                executable from anywhere in my PC from the command prompt.  This consists of moving an executable file to the pathway
                <i>/usr/local/bin</i>, which is the Linux directory for non-system, locally produced scripts.  We grant the file priveleges
                with the shell command <i>chmod +x file.py</i>, and can move it to our <i>/bin/</i> directory via the <i>sudo mv file.py</i>
                shell command.  Now the script can be called to run at anytime from any directory.</p>
            <img src="../image/working_game.jpg">
            <p>I would like to find a cleaner way to make the string comparisons between <i>comp_select</i> and <i>user_select.</i>
                It does not seem "pythonic" to chain so many if/else statements, but it is the path set forth.  Eventually I would like to 
                put this game into some type of GUI format.  I think it would be valuable to show some UI skills, but then again, I am building
                <em>programming</em> skills.  Please stay tuned for more projects!</p>
