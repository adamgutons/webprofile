            <h3>File-write practice with rock-paper-scissors</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>This is a simple game script from my beginnings with Python over last summer.  It was a concentrated
                effort in not sucking at program logic, and crafting a command prompt text game (as simple as it may be...)
                I really wanted to demonstrate some logic and some method encapsulation.  But
                looking at the code again, I can see it is really just two methods....
                <i>play_game()</i> and <i>main()</i>.  Let's take a look at the beginning.</p><p>I create
                three variable in the main method, an int <i>game_counter = 0</i>, a bool 
                <i>start_game = True</i>, and a text file variable called <i>dat_file</i>.  The
                game_counter will track the number of games played by the user.
                "start_game" will act as the control for ending the game.  "dat_file" will
                record the game records between the user and the program.</p>
            <img src="../image/rps_code1.jpg">
            <p>
                At the top of the file I define the method play_game.  This method takes in
                the game_counter, start_game, and dat_file arguments created in the main
                method.  User input is gathered by the input() method, and I use the standard 
                library "random" module to simulate the program selecting a choice between strings
                of "rock", "paper", or "scissors".  If the user enters "quit", the program exits and
                closes the data file.  If the user types "rock", "paper", or "scissors", we enter the
                else chain.
            </p>
            <img src="../image/rps_code2.jpg">
            <p>Here begins a chain of successive if/else statements.  First, three variables <i>a, b, c</i> store
                strings with different read outs, "You Win!, Computer Wins!, or Tie game...".  These hard-coded
                strings allowed me to write to file easier through the if/else chains. A string comparison drives
                the chain, so we compare the variable <i>comp_select</i> (generated by the <i>random.choice()</i> method
                to the <i>user_select</i> string entry.  If the user and "computer" pick the same choice, <i>readout</i>
                will concatenate "Game", the game count (set by <i>game_counter</i>), and a hardcoded string for win, lose,
                or tie.  With <i>readout</i> stroing one concatenated string, it then gets dumped into the <i>dat_file</i>
                text file.  This same process occurs when the computer and user choice are different.  The <i>elif</i> chain
                has nested <i>if/else</i> statements that will write different results to <i>dat_file</i> depending on the result
                of rock, paper, scissors.  Finally, the script will return a message about invalid user entry if the user types
                anythying other than rock, paper, or scissors into the console.  ISN'T COMPUTER GAMING GLORIOUS?!?

            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>I must submit to the will of the programming gods.  It is a life long learning journey, especially for someone
            who has only picked up their technical studies within the last year.  What I mean is that I am constantly learning.
            The process of making this game over a few nights last summer (yes a few nights...) was envigorating.  First, I am proud
            because I accomplished this script without consulting google.  Second, I am proud because I was able to make this script
            executable from anywhere in my PC from the command prompt.  This consists of moving an executable file to the pathway
            <i>/usr/local/bin</i>, which is the Linux directory for non-system, locally produced scripts.  We grant the file priveleges
            with the shell command <i>chmod +x file.py</i>, and can move it to our <i>/bin/</i> directory via the <i>sudo mv file.py</i>
            shell command.  Now the script can be called to run at anytime from any directory.</p>
            <img src="../image/working_game.jpg">
            <p>I would like to find a cleaner way to make the string comparisons between <i>comp_select</i> and <i>user_select.</i>
            It does not seem "pythonic" to chain so many if/else statements, but it is the path set forth.  Eventually I would like to 
            put this game into some type of GUI format.  I think it would be valuable to show some UI skills, but then again, I am building
            <em>programming</em> skills.  Please stay tuned for more projects!</p>
