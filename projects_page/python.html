            <h3>File-write practice with rock-paper-scissors</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>This is a simple game script from my beginnings with Python over last summer.  It was a concentrated
                effort in not sucking at program logic, and crafting a command prompt text game (as simple as it may be...)
                I really wanted to demonstrate some logic and some method encapsulation.  But
                looking at the code again, I can see it is really just two methods....
                <i>play_game()</i> and <i>main()</i>.  Let's take a look at the beginning.</p><p>I create
                three variable in the main method, an int <i>game_counter = 0</i>, a bool 
                <i>start_game = True</i>, and a text file variable called <i>dat_file</i>.  The variables
                <i>game_counter</i> will track the number of games played by the user,
                <i>start_game</i> will act as the control for ending the game, <i>dat_file</i> will
                record the game records between the user and the program.</p>
            <img src="../image/rps_code1.jpg">
            <p>
                At the top of the file I define the method <i>play_game</i>.  This method takes in
                the <i>game_counter, start_game,</i> and <i>dat_file</i> arguments created in the main
                method.  User input is gathered by the <i>input()</i> method, and I use the standard 
                library "random" module to simulate the program selecting a choice between strings
                of "rock", "paper", or "scissors".  If the user enters "quit", the program exits and
                closes the data file.  If the user types "rock", "paper", or "scissors", we enter the
                else chain.
            </p>
            <img src="../image/rps_code2.jpg">
            <p>Here begins a chain of successive if/else statements.  First, three variables <i>a, b, c</i> store
                strings with different read outs, "You Win!, Computer Wins!, or Tie game...".  These hard-coded
                strings allowed me to write to file easier through the if/else chains. A string comparison drives
                the chain, so we compare the variable <i>comp_select</i> (generated by the <i>random.choice()</i> method
                to the <i>user_select</i> string entry.  If the user and "computer" pick the same choice, <i>readout</i>
                will concatenate "Game", the game count (set by <i>game_counter</i>), and a hardcoded string for "win, lose,
                or tie".  With <i>readout</i> storing one concatenated string, it then gets dumped into the <i>dat_file</i>
                text file.  This same process occurs when the computer and user choice are different.  The <i>elif</i> chain
                has nested <i>if/else</i> statements that will write different results to <i>dat_file</i> depending on the result
                of rock, paper, scissors.  Finally, the script will return a message about invalid user entry if the user types
                anythying other than rock, paper, or scissors into the console.  ISN'T COMPUTER GAMING GLORIOUS?!?

            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>I must submit to the will of the programming gods.  It is a life long learning journey, especially for someone
                who has only picked up their technical studies within the last year.  What I mean is that I am constantly learning.
                The process of making this game over a few nights last summer (yes a few nights...) was envigorating.  First, I am proud
                because I accomplished this script without consulting google.  Second, I am proud because I was able to make this script
                executable from anywhere in my PC from the command prompt.  This consists of moving an executable file to the pathway
                <i>/usr/local/bin</i>, which is the Linux directory for non-system, locally produced scripts.  We grant the file priveleges
                with the shell command <i>chmod +x file.py</i>, and can move it to our <i>/bin/</i> directory via the <i>sudo mv file.py</i>
                shell command.  Now the script can be called to run at anytime from any directory.</p>
            <img src="../image/working_game.jpg">
            <p>I would like to find a cleaner way to make the string comparisons between <i>comp_select</i> and <i>user_select.</i>
                It does not seem "pythonic" to chain so many if/else statements, but it is the path set forth.  Eventually I would like to 
                put this game into some type of GUI format.  I think it would be valuable to show some UI skills, but then again, I am building
                <em>programming</em> skills.  Please stay tuned for more projects!</p>

            <h3>Working with JSON</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>This project came from a Python II study of the JSON module.  The module study
                was born out of a broad exploration of how files work in Python.  I am happy to say
                that the script is fully methodized (modularized?) and looks pretty clean.  I am still
                learning about the proper way to break a script into methods.  Let's first look
                at <i>main()</i></p>
            <img src="../image/json_code1.jpg">
            <p>First I call on the <i>load_JSON()</i> method which will open a JSON file, convert
                the file data to a dictionary object, and return the object to a variable in <i>main()</i>
                named <i>dictFromCgCap</i>.  The particular JSON file that we are using was obtained from
                <a href="https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/capital-projects" target="_blank">WPRDC</a> and contains property 
                data collected from the Pittsburgh PA region.This is the essential piece of the program.  Python allows us to convert the JSON file
                to a dictionary object that we can iterate through and parse the data.  The dictionary object is then sent to the 
                <i>AssembleAllLists()</i> method. If the dictionary object is the essential piece (or <i>key</i> if we are being meta) to the script, the
                <i>AssembleAllLists()</i> method is the work-horse.  This method takes in the dictionary object
                as an argument.  First it generates three list objects that will be passed into other script methods
                via diciontary iteriation by the key <i>'features'</i>.  This key comes directly from the converted 
                JSON file. Nested in the <i>'features'</i> key is an additional dictionary accessed by the key <i>'properties</i> 
                which contains the data we want.  This is a neat way to dig into diciontaries that are nested within other 
                dictionaries.</p>
            <img src="../image/json_code3.jpg">
            <p>
                There are a few utility methods that work to extract data from the converted JSON.  The AssembleList() methods
                will take in the 'properties' dictionary from dictFromCgCap, as well as an empty list.  From the 'properties', each assemble 
                method will append items from 'area', 'status', and 'asset_type'.  The reason for extracting the values from these dictionaries was
                to create a searchable list for the user.  After the items have been extracted from the 'area', 'status', and 'asset_type' lists, they are
                passed to createUniqueLists().  This simple method takes in a list, passes it to the built-in set() method which will refine a set of unique values/objects,
                and then pass this set to the built-in list() method to have a unique list.  The reason for compiling this list, is so that it can be assmbled into a 
                new dictionary in the main method, called <i>bigSearchDict</i>.  Again, this dicitionary will be used to compare and search values in the 
                JSON file.  Here is some output to make sense of things...</p>
            <img src="../image/python_json_working1.jpg">
            <p>
                The user is first prompted to search for the 'area', 'status', or 'asset_type'.  The AssembleAllLists() method will create the unique search values for each of the 
                three criteria.  In the example, the user enters 'area' and is prompted with four different 'area' types to search by.  One of the draw backs to the program is the brittle
                nature of the user entry.  The program is unforgiving, and user entry must be case sensitive and exact with spelling.  I wrapped the 
                main methods in try/except to mitigate some constant frustration when the user enters an extra space or character.  Once the user enters both search criteria, the program will
                print out "JSON file written..." when successful.
            </p>

            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>
                Here is the contents of the 'new_data.txt' file which the JSON module uses to dump the data collected by the program, as specified by the user search criteria.
                We see what looks to be a Python dictionary, but it is a Javascript object.  The first object property is "Facility Improvement" whose property value is a another Javascript object.
                The second object contains two properties, "budgeted_amount" and "id".  Their property values are lists containg the budget amounts and id numbers from our user search (collected from the CGCapitalProject JSON file).

            <img src="../image/json_code5.jpg">
            <p>
            I'm somehwat happy with this little script. It took some tinkering and I am not done yet.  I did not get a chance to feed the JSON file that the user collects,
            back in to the program. An option for the assignment was to use a JSON file to search the larger data structure, and return some interesting stats such as average budgeted amount per status or area.
            I like that the script is methodized.  I do not like the large 'options' string variable that gums up the enterSearchCrtieria() method.  Stay tuned for more...
