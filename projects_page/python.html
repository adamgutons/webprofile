            <h3>File-write practice with rock-paper-scissors</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>This is a simple game script from my beginnings with Python over last summer.  It was a concentrated
                effort in not sucking at program logic, and crafting a command prompt text game (as simple as it may be...)
                I really wanted to demonstrate some logic and some method encapsulation.  But
                looking at the code again, I can see it is really just two methods....
                <i>play_game()</i> and <i>main()</i>.  Let's take a look at the beginning.</p><p>I create
                three variable in the main method, an int <i>game_counter = 0</i>, a bool 
                <i>start_game = True</i>, and a text file variable called <i>dat_file</i>.  The variables
                <i>game_counter</i> will track the number of games played by the user,
                <i>start_game</i> will act as the control for ending the game, <i>dat_file</i> will
                record the game records between the user and the program.</p>
            <img src="../image/rps_code1.jpg">
            <p>
                At the top of the file I define the method <i>play_game</i>.  This method takes in
                the <i>game_counter, start_game,</i> and <i>dat_file</i> arguments created in the main
                method.  User input is gathered by the <i>input()</i> method, and I use the standard 
                library "random" module to simulate the program selecting a choice between strings
                of "rock", "paper", or "scissors".  If the user enters "quit", the program exits and
                closes the data file.  If the user types "rock", "paper", or "scissors", we enter the
                else chain.
            </p>
            <img src="../image/rps_code2.jpg">
            <p>Here begins a chain of successive if/else statements.  First, three variables <i>a, b, c</i> store
                strings with different read outs, "You Win!, Computer Wins!, or Tie game...".  These hard-coded
                strings allowed me to write to file easier through the if/else chains. A string comparison drives
                the chain, so we compare the variable <i>comp_select</i> (generated by the <i>random.choice()</i> method
                to the <i>user_select</i> string entry.  If the user and "computer" pick the same choice, <i>readout</i>
                will concatenate "Game", the game count (set by <i>game_counter</i>), and a hardcoded string for "win, lose,
                or tie".  With <i>readout</i> storing one concatenated string, it then gets dumped into the <i>dat_file</i>
                text file.  This same process occurs when the computer and user choice are different.  The <i>elif</i> chain
                has nested <i>if/else</i> statements that will write different results to <i>dat_file</i> depending on the result
                of rock, paper, scissors.  Finally, the script will return a message about invalid user entry if the user types
                anythying other than rock, paper, or scissors into the console.  ISN'T COMPUTER GAMING GLORIOUS?!?

            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>I must submit to the will of the programming gods.  It is a life long learning journey, especially for someone
                who has only picked up their technical studies within the last year.  What I mean is that I am constantly learning.
                The process of making this game over a few nights last summer (yes a few nights...) was envigorating.  First, I am proud
                because I accomplished this script without consulting google.  Second, I am proud because I was able to make this script
                executable from anywhere in my PC from the command prompt.  This consists of moving an executable file to the pathway
                <i>/usr/local/bin</i>, which is the Linux directory for non-system, locally produced scripts.  We grant the file priveleges
                with the shell command <i>chmod +x file.py</i>, and can move it to our <i>/bin/</i> directory via the <i>sudo mv file.py</i>
                shell command.  Now the script can be called to run at anytime from any directory.</p>
            <img src="../image/working_game.jpg">
            <p>I would like to find a cleaner way to make the string comparisons between <i>comp_select</i> and <i>user_select.</i>
                It does not seem "pythonic" to chain so many if/else statements, but it is the path set forth.  Eventually I would like to 
                put this game into some type of GUI format.  I think it would be valuable to show some UI skills, but then again, I am building
                <em>programming</em> skills.  Please stay tuned for more projects!</p>

            <h3>Working with JSON</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>This project came from a Python II study of the JSON module.  The module study
                was born out of a broad exploration of how files work in Python.  I am happy to say
                that the script is fully methodized (modularized?) and looks pretty clean.  I am still
                learning about the proper way to break a script into methods.  Let's first look
                at <i>main()</i></p>
            <img src="../image/json_code1.jpg">
            <p>First I call on the <i>load_JSON()</i> method which will open a JSON file, convert
                the file data to a dictionary object, and return the object to a variable in <i>main()</i>
                named <i>dictFromCgCap</i>.  The particular JSON file that we are using was obtained from
                <a href="https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/capital-projects" target="_blank">WPRDC</a> and contains property 
                data collected from the Pittsburgh PA region.
                This is the essential piece of the program.  Python allows us to convert the JSON file
                to a dictionary object that we can iterate through and parse the data.  With a dictionary object
                to pass around, it is then sent to the <i>AssembleAllLists()</i> method. If the dictionary
                object is the essential piece (or <i>key</i> if we are being meta) to the script, the
                <i>AssembleAllLists()</i> method is the work-horse.  This method takes in the dictionary object
                as an argument.  First it generates three list objects that will be passed into other script methods
                via diciontary iteriation by the key <i>'features'</i>.  This key comes directly from the converted 
                JSON file. Nested in the <i>'features'</i> key is an additional dictionary accessed by the key <i>'properties</i> 
                which contains the data we want.  This is a neat way to dig into diciontaries that are nested within other 
                dictionaries.</p>
